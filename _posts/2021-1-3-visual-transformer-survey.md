Transformer is a type of deep neural network mainlybased on self-attention mechanism which is originally appliedin natural language processing field. Inspired by the strong representation ability of transformer, researchers propose to extend transformer for computer vision tasks.Transformer-based models show competitive and even betterperformance on various visual benchmarks comparedto other network types such as convolutional networks andrecurrent networks. In this paper we provide a literature review of these visual transformer models by categorizingthem in different tasks and analyze the advantages and disadvantagesof these methods. In particular, the main categories include the basic image classification, high-level vision,low-level vision and video processing. Self-attentionin computer vision is also briefly revisited as self-attention is the base component in transformer. Efficient transformermethods are included for pushing transformer into real applications. Finally, we give a discussion about the furtherresearch directions for visual transformer.
