title: "Passive Diagnosis incorporating the PHQ-4 for Depression and Anxiety"
---

Depression and anxiety are the two most prevalent mental health disorders worldwide, impacting the lives of millions of people each
year. In this work, we develop and evaluate a multilabel, multidimensional deep neural network designed to predict PHQ-4 scores based
on individuals written text. Our system outperforms random baseline metrics and provides a novel approach to how we can predict psychometric
scores from written text. Additionally, we explore how this architecture can be applied to analyse social media data.
